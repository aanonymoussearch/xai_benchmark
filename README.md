Note: used only double blind review.

This repository has the information of the benchmark developed in the authors' research (---anonymous until the article review---) titled "Does Dataset Complexity Matters for Model Explainers?".

All the information needed for a better understanding and reproducibility of the procedures performed in the research can be accessed directly on the notebook (Google Colab) available at root, as well as in the files folders.
